WORK IN PROGRESS

**Project:** Optimizing Travel Itineraries With Machine Learning

**Presentation.** Presentation can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region).

**Project goal.** An exercise in feature engineering and comparing model performance between no engineered features.

Notes on data and feature engineering: for periodic variables, like time of the day or month of the year, apply a decomposition like y = A * sin(2π * hour / 24) + B * cos(2π * hour / 24). This way one feature is broken into two linearly independent features. (careful about autocorrelation and feature independence)

**Data and Features.** The data set was taken from [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).

**Models.** TBD.

**Results.** TBD.
